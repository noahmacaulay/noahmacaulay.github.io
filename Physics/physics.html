<p> <a href = "counterexample.pdf">On "Statistical Physics of Self-Replication"</a> 
The inequality presented in "Statistical Physics of Self-Replication" is slightly wrong. I present a counterexample and derive an altered version of the inequality, and discuss its consequences for the 
main results of the paper. Note: I have informed the author of this. He agrees that the version in the paper is slightly wrong. </p>
